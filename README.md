## About Me üë¶üèª
Hey there! I am Rishav, an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Narula Institute of Technology, Kolkata. Additionally, I am pursuing a Bachelor's in Science in Data Science and Programming from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.

I am dedicated to perfecting and sharpening my skills in machine learning and continuously enhancing my computer science journey.

## Game Development üéÆ

I've embarked on the journey of game development as a hobby, driven by my passion for playing video games and the desire to bring my imaginative ideas to life. As I delved into this realm, I realized the immense technical knowledge and problem-solving skills it demands.

Game development has been a transformative experience for me, honing my problem-solving abilities, coding proficiency, and even introducing me to 3D modeling. I utilize Blender, a free software highly recommended for various tasks, to translate my ideas into captivating visuals.

I have experience working with the **Unity engine**, which uses **C#** as its programming language to build games. I have developed several arcade-style games for both PC and mobile platforms. Unfortunately, much of my work has not been recorded through a version control system like Git, and due to file size restrictions, hosting game files on GitHub has been challenging.

Recently, I have switched to the **Unreal Engine**, which uses **C++** as its programming language for game development and also includes a visual scripting system called Blueprints, based on pre-defined C++ code. I am excited to share my experiences working with this new engine. I will also strive to share my progress and projects on GitHub whenever possible.
